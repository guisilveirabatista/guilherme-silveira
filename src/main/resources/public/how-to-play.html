        <h1>Kalaha</h1>
        <p>The Kalaha board is made up of two rows of six pockets (also called “holes,” or “pits”) each.
            Four pieces are placed in each of the 12 pockets.
            The color of the pieces is irrelevant.
            Each player has a “store” (also called a “Kalaha”) to his/her right side of the Kalaha board.</p>

        <h1>Objective</h1>
        <p>The object of the game is to collect the most pieces by the end of the game.</p>

        <h1>Game Play</h1>
        <table>

            <td>

                <p>1. The game begins with one player picking up all of the pieces in any one of the pockets on his/her
                    side.
                </p>
                <p>2. Moving counter-clockwise, the player deposits one of the stones in each pocket until the stones
                    run out.
                </p>
                <p>3. If you run into your own Kalaha (store), deposit one piece in it. If you run into your opponent's
                    Kalaha,</p>
                <p>skip it and continue moving to the next pocket.</p>
                <p>4. If the last piece you drop is in your own Kalaha, you take another turn.</p>
                <p>5. If the last piece you drop is in an empty pocket on your side, you capture that piece and any
                    pieces in
                    the pocket directly opposite.</p>
            </td>
            <td>
                <p>6. Always place all captured pieces in your Kalaha (store).</p>
                <p>7. The game ends when all six pockets on one side of the Kalaha board are empty.</p>
                <p>8. The player who still has pieces on his/her side of the board when the game ends captures all of
                    those
                    pieces.</p>
                <p>9. Count all the pieces in each Kalaha. The winner is the player with the most pieces.</p>
